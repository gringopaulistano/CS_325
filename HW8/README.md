Description: The following program completes the bin packing problem using first-fit, first-fit-decreasing and best fit. This also outputs data to a file called data.txt 

I used the following links for help and reference throughout for the algorithms, as well as reading and writing to files and timing the algorithms.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org I referenced this site for loops, reading/writing to a file and pseudocode for algorithms,

I also referenced the Python Documentation (https://docs.python.org/2/contents.html) extensively for help in using Python

Testing: make sure bin.txt is in the same file as main.py.
Run python3 main.py
