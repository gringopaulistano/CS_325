Description: The following program  reads inut from the text file act.txt, and sorts the data into a list. It then continues to print out the optimal choices of activities using a greedy algorithm. <br>

I used the following links for help and reference throughout for this program implementation:

Testing: python3 greedy.py to run the program. Please make sure the act.txt file is included in the same folder
