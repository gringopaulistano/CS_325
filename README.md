<strong>Description:</strong> The following programs run insert sort and merge sort algorithms. After reading numbers in from the data.txt file, insertSort.py and mergeSort.py write the sorted arrays to merge.txt and insert.txt. There are also 2 algorithm analysing programs as well, insertTime.py and mergeTime.py. Both generate arrays of random numbers, and then output the size of said arrays and the time taken to run the algorithms.

I used the following links for help and reference throughout for the algorithms, as well as reading and writing to files and timing the algorithms. </br>

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org I referenced this site for loops, reading/writing to a file and pseudocode for algorithms, </br>

I referenced the Python Documentation extensively for the loops used, as well as geeksforgeeks and w3 schools.

<strong>Testing: </strong> insertSort.py to run the insertion sort algorithm, and output sorted data to insert.txt. </br>
                           mergeSort.py to run the merge sort algorithm, and output sorted data to merge.txt. </br>
                           insertTime.py to run the analysis of insertion sort. </br>
                           mergeTime.py to run the analysis of merge sort. </br>
